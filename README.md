### Motivation
All credits to geeksforgeeks.

I customise with one-liner jokes that better tickles me for training, improved on output that made me less "arrh" and decided to share.

joke_generate features:
* takes one-liner jokes for training
* just run! (when you are in ..ahem appreciative mood)
* save model for future training

### Install Guide
copy and run (assume linux with python3):
```
python3 -m venv test
cd test
source bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/wendy-py/pytorch-joke.git
cd pytorch-joke
pip install torch numpy pandas
python joke_generate.py
```
